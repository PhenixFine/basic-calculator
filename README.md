# basic-calculator
Stage 4 of 4 for JetBrains Academy - Android - [Basic Calculator project](https://hyperskill.org/projects/190/stages/952/implement).       
The app can do basic calculations.
## Requirements
### Description
Your app can calculate things. But you can still improve the app by automating some of its features.
### Objectives
1. Clean `editText` automatically after choosing an operation. Let's also set the entered value as a hint, so that users can see that they have typed everything correctly.
2. If you're using `Double`, you get `.0` in your result. Get rid of it when a result is a whole number.
